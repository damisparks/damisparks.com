# Dami Sparks

This repository is my website which I built in NuxtJS.
This repository is my sandbox for exploring new ideas and having fun. Feel free to look around and adapt whatever you like as the code is open-source, so if it helps, then great.

The site is static, meaning the project can be hosted free on any hosting service such as Netlify.

After cloning it, make sure you `npm install` to install everything and start the development server using `npm run dev`.
