# Dami Sparks

This repository is my website which I built in Nuxt3.
This repository is my sandbox for exploring new ideas and having fun. Feel free to look around and adapt whatever you like as the code is open-source, so if it helps, then great.

The site is static, meaning the project can be hosted free on any hosting service such as Netlify.

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
