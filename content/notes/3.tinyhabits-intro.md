# Tiny is Effective: Introduction

In a world where we are trying to learn new habits or shape the existing ones,
it is imperative to understand what makes habits stick.

I started reading more about habits, how the brain works, etc..
Hence, I started reading [BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com). **I will share** my thoughts as I read it, page by page.
Here is a quick summary. You can find the full article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@damisparks/tiny-is-effective-introduction-2235d704dab6).

## Keynotes

Three keys to designing a successful habit:

- Stop judging yourself
- Break aspirations into tiny behaviours
- Embrace mistakes as discoveries

Ways to create a lasting habit:

- Have an epiphany
- Change your environment
- Change habits in a tiny way (less than 3 seconds)

**New words.**

- **Information-Action Fallacy** (having information does not mean you change your behaviour)
