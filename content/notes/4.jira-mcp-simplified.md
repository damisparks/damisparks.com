# Jira MCP: Simplified Configuration

For Jira MCP, you don't need all that extra stuff. Here's my working syntax:

```json
{
  "mcp-atlassian": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-remote",
      "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse"
    ]
  }
}
```

That's it. No complex authentication setup, no API keys to manage upfront.

## How It Works

The configuration uses `npx` to run the remote MCP server directly from Atlassian's hosted endpoint. When you connect, it prompts for authentication via the browser - clean and secure.

## Why This Approach

Most MCP configurations require extensive setup with API keys, tokens, and complex authentication flows. This approach:

* **Eliminates upfront configuration** - no keys to generate or store
* **Uses browser-based auth** - familiar OAuth flow
* **Reduces security surface** - no local credential storage
* **Works immediately** - copy, paste, connect

## Getting Started

1. Add the configuration to your MCP setup
2. Connect to the server
3. Authenticate through your browser when prompted
4. Start using Jira MCP

The beauty is in the simplicity. Sometimes the best solution is the one that removes complexity rather than adding features.
